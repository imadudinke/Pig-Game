# Pig Game

# Introduction

Pig is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling a single die. The goal is to accumulate points without rolling a 1. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all points accumulated in that turn. Players can choose to "hold" their current score at any point, adding it to their total score. The first player to reach a score of 20 or more wins the game.
